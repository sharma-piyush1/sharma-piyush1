📈 Analytics Aficionado: I believe that numbers have tales to tell. Whether it’s visualizing trends in Power BI or crunching numbers in Python, I’m all about turning data into actionable insights. 📊

🤖 Machine Learning Enthusiast: When I’m not sifting through spreadsheets, I’m tinkering with algorithms. From regression models to neural networks, I love exploring the fascinating world of ML. 🤖

👨‍💻 SQL Sorcerer: My spells involve SELECTs, JOINs, and GROUP BYs. I’ve summoned data from databases far and wide, and I’m always up for a new SQL adventure. 💫

What You’ll Find Here
📚 Code Chronicles: Expect snippets of Python, R, and SQL. Whether it’s a data preprocessing script or a cool visualization, I’ve got you covered. 💻

📊 Dashboard Diaries: I create interactive dashboards in Power BI that make data dance. Let’s turn those raw numbers into a visual symphony! 🎨

🧠 Machine Learning Musings: Curious about random forests, gradient boosting, or deep learning? Join me as I explore ML concepts and share my experiments. 🌟
